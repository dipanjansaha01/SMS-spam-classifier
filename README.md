# SMS Spam Classifier

## Project Description
The **SMS Spam Classifier** is a machine learning project designed to categorize SMS messages into two categories: **Spam** and **Ham (Not Spam)**. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms, this project provides a reliable way to detect unwanted messages.

This project includes a user-friendly interface built using **Streamlit**, allowing users to input text and instantly classify it as spam or ham.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess text messages to remove noise (e.g., stopwords, punctuation).
- **Feature Extraction**: Convert text into numerical data using techniques like TF-IDF.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Train and evaluate classification algorithms using **Scikit-learn**.
- **Interactive UI**: A Streamlit-based application for real-time message classification.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language used for building the project.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and exploration.
- **Scikit-learn**: For building and evaluating machine learning models.
- **NLTK**: For natural language processing tasks like tokenization and stopword removal.
- **Streamlit**: For building the web-based user interface.
